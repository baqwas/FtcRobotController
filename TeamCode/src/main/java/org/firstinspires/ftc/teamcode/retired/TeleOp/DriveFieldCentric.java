/*
 * This OpMode executes a POV Game style Teleop for a direct drive robot
 * The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 *
 * In this mode the left stick moves the robot FWD and back, the Right stick turns left and right.
 * It raises and lowers the arm using the Gamepad Y and A buttons respectively.
 * It also opens and closes the claws slowly using the left and right Bumper buttons.
 *
 * Field Centric https://gm0.org/en/latest/docs/software/tutorials/mecanum-drive.html
 * Gamepad https://gm0.org/en/latest/docs/software/tutorials/gamepad.html
 * proved here https://matthew-brett.github.io/teaching/rotation_2d.html
 * Then, the translation joystick values need to be counterrotated by the robot heading.
 * The IMU returns heading, however we need to rotate the movement counter to the robotâ€™s rotation,
 * so its negative is taken. The joystick values are a vector, and rotating a vector in 2D requires
 * this formula (proved here), where x1 and y1 are the components of the original vector,
 * b is the angle to rotate by, x2 and y2 are the components of the resultant vector.
 *  x2 = x1 * cos(b) - y1 * sin(b)
 *  y2 = x1 * sin(b) + y1 * cos(b)
