/**
 * {@link HelloTeleOp} is a basic TeleOp OpMode used for initial robot testing.

 * for the FTC Robot Controller SDK.
 *
 * <p>It demonstrates the fundamental lifecycle of a LinearOpMode, including
 * initialization, waiting for start, and running a main control loop. The use of
 * telemetry for debugging is also highlighted.</p>
