# ðŸ“œ Code of Conduct
## Our Pledge 
As members of FTC Team [Your Team Number], we pledge to make participation in our project and our team a harassment-free and inclusive experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, experience level, gender identity and expression, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are a rookie team, and our primary focus is on learning, collaboration, and gracious professionalism. Every member should feel safe, supported, and encouraged to contribute.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:
* Be Welcoming and Inclusive: We treat all team members and mentors with respect. We value diverse opinions and experiences. 
* Be Patient and Encouraging: Everyone is learning! Whether it's Java, CAD, or hardware, we help each other and celebrate small victories. There are no "stupid questions." 
* Be Respectful of Differences: Disagreements about code or robot design are normal, but we must discuss them constructively and professionally. Focus on the idea, not the person. 
* Communicate Clearly: Use clear language in documentation, code comments, and discussions. Be mindful of how your words may be interpreted by others. 
* Accept Constructive Criticism: When reviewing code or designs, provide helpful feedback. When receiving criticism, accept it graciously and see it as an opportunity to improve.

## Unacceptable Behavior 
Examples of unacceptable behavior include: 
* Harassment: Offensive comments related to any personal characteristic (as listed above).  
* Exclusion: Intentionally excluding someone from team discussions, meetings, or activities. 
* Trolling or Insulting/Derogatory Comments: Personal attacks, flaming, or making fun of a team member's skills or knowledge. 
* Public or Private Harassment: This includes posting private information (e.g., physical address, personal photos) without explicit permission. 
* Unprofessional Conduct: Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting. 

## Enforcement and Reporting 
If a team member engages in unacceptable behavior, the lead mentor or designated team captain may take any action they deem appropriate, including a warning or temporary/permanent removal from the team. 
### How to Report an Issue 
If you witness or are subject to unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it immediately to one of the following individuals: 
1. Lead Mentor: 
2. Team Captain: 
3. Other Trusted Adult/Mentor: 

All reports will be reviewed promptly and handled with confidentiality and discretion. We are committed to resolving every reported issue fairly and thoroughly.
